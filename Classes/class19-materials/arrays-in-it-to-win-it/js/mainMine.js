//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.

movies = ["Bring it On", "Clueless", "Mean Girls"]

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable

bestMovie = movies[0]

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable

howLong = movies.length

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?

lastOne = movies.pop[]
