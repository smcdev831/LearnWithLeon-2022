Question 1
Select the following true statements about sleep (according to the video lectures).


1 / 1 point

During sleep, your brain assumes a very quiescent state where nothing much is going on neurologically speaking.  No changes in cell size are observed, although some changes in cells' flexibility have been seen.  This flexibility change is what allows you to dream your way towards solutions.



Sleep, which can sometimes seem like SUCH a waste of time—is actually your brain’s way of keeping itself clean and healthy.


Correct
True.


Taking a test without getting enough sleep means you are operating with a brain that’s got  metabolic toxins floating around in it—poisons that make it so you can’t think very clearly. It’s kind of like trying to drive a car that’s got sugar in its gas tank—doesn’t work too well!


Correct
True.


As mentioned in the videos, sleeping is simply an evolutionary means of taking things easy.


2.
Question 2
You are sitting down to do your homework.  You work along, successfully solving the problems.  But you then come across a problem that is more difficult.  After spending fifteen minutes working on it, you begin to find yourself growing frustrated.  What is the single most reasonable next option for you to take in order for you to make progress towards the solution?


1 / 1 point

Although you may really want to focus on the problem, because focused attention works to help solve easier problems, you actually need to get your conscious attention OFF the problem in order to allow other "resting" neural states (the "diffuse mode") to work on it.



Keep working late into the night—feeling exhausted, but NOT letting yourself sleep, will help you envision the solution.



Repeat the question soundlessly to yourself.



Try to avoid blinking while solving the problem.


Correct
That's right!  Switching your attention from your focused to a more diffuse way of analyzing the problem can help you retrench and tackle what you are doing in new and better ways.

3.
Question 3
Select the following true statements about memory according to the information provided in the videos.


1 / 1 point

Your working memory is centered within the prefrontal cortex, although there are also connections to other parts of your brain so you can access long-term memories.


Correct
True.


To help with moving something into long term memory, use a technique called “spaced repetition.” This technique involves repeating what you are trying to retain, but what you want to do is to space this repetition out—repeating a new vocabulary word or problem-solving technique, for example, over a number of days.


Correct
True.


To help with moving something into long term memory, use a technique called “stressed repetition.” This technique involves stressing what you are trying to retain in a short period of time—repeating a new vocabulary word or problem-solving technique, for example, twenty times in one evening.



Working memory is the part of memory that has to do with what you are immediately and consciously processing in your mind.


Correct
True.

4.
Question 4
The following actions help enable the focused mode (check all that apply):


1 / 1 point

Going for a walk and thinking about nothing in particular.



Sitting in a train and absently watching the scenery pass by.



Ensuring that you plan rewards for yourself after periods of focused attention.


Correct
That's right!  Rewarding yourself AFTER focusing allows you to gradually begin enjoying your periods of concentration more.


Setting a timer and "doing a Pomodoro."


Correct
That's right—the Pomodoro Technique is associated with use of the focused mode.

5.
Question 5
Which of the following statements are true about chunks and/or chunking?


1 / 1 point

The concept of neural “chunks” applies to sports, music, dance—really, just about anything that humans can get good at.


Correct
True.


A disadvantage of chunking is that chunks take more neural energy to process, which slows your thinking.



Chunking does NOT involve knitting together ideas or actions.  For example, the many complex activities involved in getting dressed CANNOT be thought of as a single, simple chunk.



Focused practice and repetition—the creation of strong memory traces—helps you to create chunks.


Correct
True.

6.
Question 6
Select the following true statements about thinking and learning:


1 / 1 point

Counting backwards from 100 is an effective method for activating the diffuse mode of thinking.



Our brain uses two very different processes for thinking—the focused and diffuse modes. You generally toggle back and forth between these modes, using one or the other.


Correct
True.


To figure out new ideas and solve problems, it’s often important not only to focus initially, but also to subsequently turn our focus away from what we want to learn, so that we can use other, more diffuse ways to process the new information.


Correct
True.


To learn most effectively, all you need to do is understand the basic concept.  Practice and repetition kills your creativity, so it's best avoided.


7.
Question 7
Select the following true statements, as taught in this course, regarding the concept of "understanding."


0.5 / 1 point

Understanding alone is in general enough to create a chunk.


This should not be selected
False. Understanding coupled with practice and repetition in a variety of contexts is what is needed to make a chunk.   Do not confuse the “aha!” of a breakthrough in understanding with solid expertise—or the smooth connections of a well-established chunk.


Understanding is unrelated to chunking.



Can you create a chunk if you don’t understand? Yes, but it’s often a useless chunk that won’t fit in with or relate to other material you are learning.



You often realize the first time you truly understand something is when you can actually do it yourself.


Correct
True.

8.
Question 8
Check the following true statements regarding illusions of competence in learning, as described in the videos.


1 / 1 point

Merely glancing at a solution and thinking you truly know it yourself is one of the most common illusions of competence in learning.


Correct
True.


Recall—simply looking away from the material and attempting to recall the main ideas—is a more effective study technique than rereading the material.


Correct
True.


Multitasking—that is, paying attention to several things at once when you are studying, has been shown to be exceptionally effective, but only when you are highly stressed, which is why it's not recommended.



Concept mapping is a more effective study method than recall, that is, simply looking away from the material and attempting to recall the main ideas.


9.
Question 9
Check the following true statements regarding the concept of recall.


1 / 1 point

Using recall—mental retrieval of the key ideas—rather than passive rereading will make your study time more focused and effective


Correct
True.


Recall is best done where you originally learned the material because repeating in the same room is the best way to deepen your neural structures so that you perform well on tests.



A helpful way to make sure you’re learning, and not fooling yourself with illusions of competence, is to TEST yourself on what you’re learning. In some sense, that’s what recall is actually doing—allowing you to see whether or not you really grasped an idea.


Correct
True.


Recalling when you are sitting in a lower position in the room can help you better remember the foundations ("the lower parts") of what you are studying.


10.
Question 10
Select the true statements below regarding the concept of overlearning:


0.75 / 1 point

Automaticity can indeed be helpful in times of nervousness. But be wary of repetitive overlearning during a single session—research has shown it can be a waste of valuable learning time.


Correct
True.


Overlearning what you are learning is one of the best ways to avoid Einstellung.



Continuing to study or practice after you’ve mastered what you can in the session is called overlearning.



You should focus on overlearning whenever you sit down to study.

11.
Question 11
Select the correct answers here with relation to procrastination, according to the videos.


1 / 1 point

By focusing on product rather than process, you allow yourself to back away from judging yourself (Am I getting closer to finishing? ) and allow yourself to relax into the flow of the work.



One of the easiest ways to focus on process is to focus on doing a Pomodoro—a twenty-five-minute timed work session.  (Do NOT focus on completing a task.)


Correct

It is best to try to focus on process, not product, because the product is often what triggers the pain that causes you to procrastinate.


Correct

One of the easiest ways to focus on product is to use the diffuse mode


12.
Question 12
Select all options that are good study and learning methods that can be used to remember something well.


1 / 1 point

When learning something for the first time, try to make the concept or idea into something memorable like associating it with an object or a funny picture in your mind.  An example in the videos involved learning the equation f = ma by associating the equation with a flying mule.


Correct
Making vivid pictures is an outstanding method for helping you to more easily recall the material.


Take breaks during your study time to let your mind rest and to reward yourself for your good study habits.


Correct
Taking breaks between periods of intense focusing helps rewire your brain so that you anticipate the pleasure of the break--which also helps you enjoy your periods of focused attention more.


Eat lots of cake while studying because it will make you happy and happiness is the key to memorizing large quantities of data.



Cram as much as you can right before the test date—that way you won't forget things.


13.
Question 13
Choose all of the true statements about using memorizing techniques such as a "memory palace."


1 / 1 point

You must always have a partner to help you employ a memory palace so that you can help each other practice and sharpen your skills in a group setting.



Memory palaces are useful when you need to relate unrelated items in your mind, such as a grocery list.


Correct
True.


As discussed in the video, memory techniques usually only work for people on a holiday because their minds are so much more relaxed.



Using these memory techniques allows you to more deeply internalize the information you are using, allowing you to use it much more effectively than if you were to simply try to memorize it by repeating it many times.


Correct
True.

14.
Question 14
What are the four categories of cues that were explained in the video as causing people to fall into a habitual reaction (what might be thought of as a "zombie" response mode)?


0 / 1 point

Location, time, how you feel, reaction (either to other people or to something that just happened)



Identify, define, optimize, verify



A man, a plan, a canal, Panama



Location, identification, indentation, subliminal (either internal or external)


Incorrect

16.
Question 16
Select all of the true statements about the purpose and benefits of writing a list of the tasks you want to perform.


1 / 1 point

As discussed in the videos, task lists help activate Einstellung, which is why you should use them.



Making a task list and then throwing it away, as described in one of the videos, is one of the most effective ways of using a task list.



It is better to make a task list before you go to sleep, so your subconscious, "diffuse" thinking processes can have a chance to help assist you in actually accomplishing the tasks the next day.


Correct

As a video mentioned, making a task list  makes your tasks easier to remember, WITHOUT having to use much of your valuable working memory.


Correct
17.
Question 17
Select the following true statements in relation to metaphor and analogy.


0.75 / 1 point

It’s often helpful to pretend YOU are the concept you are trying to understand.



As the videos emphasized, using sophisticated words like "metaphor" and "analogy" makes you feel smarter and improves your confidence, which leads to better study outcomes.



Metaphors and visualization—being able to see something in your mind’s eye—have been especially helpful, not only in art and literature, but also in allowing the scientific and engineering world to make progress.


Correct

Metaphors and analogies, as well as stories, can sometimes be useful for getting people out of Einstellung—being blocked by thinking about a problem in the wrong way


Correct

Question 18
As Dr. Sejnowski mentioned in one of his videos, new neurons are born in your hippocampus every day.  These neurons can survive and help you remember things if you (check all that apply):


1 / 1 point

Read a book about a new subject area


Correct
Two experiences that help your neurons to grow and survive are exercise and exposure to new environments or ideas.  Reading about something new is definitely exposing yourself to new ideas!


Procrastinate.



Learn a new dance movement


Correct
Two experiences that help your neurons to grow and survive are exercise and exposure to new environments or ideas.  Learning something new, like dance, is definitely exposing yourself to new ideas!


Travel to an exotic foreign country and experience new and different ways of doing things.


Correct
Two experiences that help your neurons to grow and survive are exercise and exposure to new environments or ideas.  Travel to new places is definitely exposure to a new environment!

19.
Question 19
Choose the statements below that best describe the “Imposter Syndrome.”


1 / 1 point

The "imposter syndrome" involves an old psychological theory involving acting out your fears.  Researchers have recently debunked the theory.



The imposter syndrome is a very rare condition.



Getting a good grade on a test but being convinced that it was luck and that you are sure to fail the next test and be exposed as a fraud, is a good example of the imposter syndrome.


Correct

Imposter syndrome involves frequent feelings of inadequacy.


Correct
20.
Question 20
Santiago Ramon y Cajal felt that the key to his success was his ____________, which he called "the virtue of the less brilliant." (Select the appropriate word to fill in the blank.)


1 / 1 point

perseverance



untested but undeniable high IQ



sense of humor



vision


Correct
21.
Question 21
Select all true statements about teamwork.


1 / 1 point

It's okay to start study sessions ten to fifteen minutes late, but no more than that.



The best study sessions with others start on time, stay on task and contain a bare minimum of small talk in order to focus on the purpose for the gathering.  The time for play is after the work is done.


Correct

One of the videos emphasized that you should NOT look the material over before you arrive and meet with your study group.



One of the best ways to catch your blind spots and errors is to brainstorm and work with others who are also smartly focused on the topic.


Correct
22.
Question 22
Select all of the true statements about including "mini tests" in your regular study sessions


1 / 1 point

Tests during study sessions are good for concentrating the mind.


Correct

Testing yourself during study sessions is not beneficial to most students because it adds too much stress and anxiety and will inhibit learning.



As one of the videos asserted, you will learn and retain more in one hour of testing than you would if you spent one hour studying.


Correct

As one of the videos mentioned, testing yourself during studying is only effective for language studies.


23.
Question 23
Select all of the questions that come from Dr. Richard Felder's "test checklist." Do whatever it takes to answer yes to most of the questions on this list.


0.7142857142857143 / 1 point

Did you get a reasonable night’s sleep before the test?


Correct

Did you make a genuine effort to get the test questions and answers at least a week in advance from the teaching assistant?



If you had a study guide, did you carefully go through it before the test and convince yourself you understood all of the material?



Did you consume an adequate amount of chocolate before sitting for the test?



Did you work with classmates on homework problems?



Did you consult with the instructor/teach assistants when you were having trouble?


Correct

If there was a review session, did you attend and ask questions about any concepts or ideas that you were unsure of?


Correct
You didn’t select all the correct answers
24.
Question 24
Choose all of the true statements about the "hard start, jump to easy" test taking technique.


0.75 / 1 point

The hardest part of this technique for many students is that you must have the self-discipline to pull yourself off of a problem you are stuck on and move to another question.


Correct

In order for this technique to work, you must do a lot of exercise before taking the test—without the exercise, the technique is MUCH less effective.



By alternating between different problems you are employing your brain’s diffuse thinking strategy, because when you turn your attention AWAY from a problem, you are allowing other, more diffuse, resting state neural networks a chance to work on that problem.


Correct

This method involves starting with the easiest problems in order to build up your confidence for the harder test questions later.


This should not be selected
25.
Question 25
Select all of the true statements about pre-test stress and how to overcome it.


1 / 1 point

There is no way to fight stress, embrace the panic; it will subside on its own… eventually.



As one of the videos mentioned, if you are a naturally anxious person you should just accept the fact that you're doomed—you will always suffer on tests. By realizing this, you relax into it.



When stressed before a test, you should turn your attention to your breathing. Taking deep breaths can control your stress level and fight the "fight or flight" instinct.


Correct

One easy way to overcome the effects of stress and cortisol is to tell yourself that you are not afraid of failing the test but instead, that you are EXCITED to take the test and get a good grade.


Correct
26.
Question 26
Select  test taking tips that were mentioned in the videos.


1 / 1 point

During the test, try to momentarily shift your attention away from the test questions and then go back through the questions with a ‘big picture’ perspective.


Correct

A good tip for test taking, as mentioned in one of the videos, is to quietly tap your knee while you are taking the test.



Pinching yourself repeatedly, as mentioned in one of the videos, is a great way to bring urgency and allow you to solve difficult problems.



When answering multiple choice questions, cover the answers and try to recall the answer on your own.


Correct
27.
Question 27
Which of the following options have been shown by research to be generally NOT as effective a method for studying—that is, which methods are more likely to be used by those suffering from illusions of competence in learning?


1 / 1 point

Recall



Deliberate practice



Rereading the text


Correct
When the text is open right in front of you, it fools you into thinking that you know the material.  But you only really know that material for certain when you can recall the material--or at least the key ideas--WITHOUT the text open in front of you.


Testing yourself



Highlighting more than one or so sentence in a paragraph


Correct
With highlighting, the fact that your hand is moving can fool you into thinking you're putting something into your brain, when you're not.
